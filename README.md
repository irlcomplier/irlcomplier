- 👋 Hi, I’m @irlcomplier
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science and coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python
- ⚡ Fun fact: I first learnt how to code at 10

- P.S: I am working on a project which is an algorithm creating a secure password with random aspects. I need to change some parts, finish it and ensure it is efficient. :)
